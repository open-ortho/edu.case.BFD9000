# BFD9000 Issue Triage and MVP Planning

**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Goal:** Deploy MVP in 2 working days (new scans only, historical cleanup deferred)

## MVP Scope

### Core Pipeline

1. **BFD9010 scanner** → acquire 2D radiographs
2. **BFD9000 web app** → operator uploads/manages scans
3. **BFD9020 AI** → automatic classification, orientation, flip detection
4. **DICOM conversion** → Secondary Capture (RG modality) using dicom4ortho templates
5. **Local file storage** → organized folder structure
6. **Box API upload** → archive to Case Western Box folder structure
7. **Database indexing** → ImagingStudy, Subject, Encounter, Record models

### Out of MVP Scope

- Historical archive cleanup (Bolton-Brush TIFF files from drives/Box)
- Advanced AI features (splitting, segmentation)
- CAS single sign-on (use Django auth for now)
- Individual record/subject detail views (list views sufficient)
- Timestamp extraction from legacy TIFFs

## PRs Needing Attention

### PR #28: Feature/26 implement DRF (2666 additions, 28 deletions)

**Status:** Open since 2025-12-01, last updated 2026-01-28  
**Branch:** feature/26-implement-drf-for-backendfrontend-separation  
**Review Comments:** Multiple unresolved from @zgypa requesting responses

**Implements:**

- Full REST API with DRF ViewSets (Subject, Encounter, Record, ImagingStudy, etc.)
- Nested routing for hierarchical resources
- File upload support (PNG, STL)
- Custom actions: /image/, /thumbnail/, /dicom/ endpoints
- OpenAPI documentation (Swagger/Redoc)
- Docker containerization
- Comprehensive test suite
- Environment-based configuration

**Remaining Work:**

- Address all review comments (zgypa requires "done" or "will not do" on each)
- Resolve human comments (leave for reviewer to close)
- Add tests for ValuesetViewSet to prevent code set cross-contamination
- Verify authentication on all routes (#36)
- Verify read-only restriction on nested records endpoint (#29)

**Decision:** High priority to merge ASAP - foundation for everything else.

### PR #31: Feature/23 initial django UI (6222 additions, 200 deletions)

**Status:** Open since 2025-12-08, no reviews yet  
**Branch:** feature/23-initial-django-ui-new

**Implements:**

- Django template-based UI with DaisyUI + TailwindCSS
- Authentication (login/logout)
- Paginated table views (subjects, encounters, records)
- Search functionality via PaginatedTableManager JS class
- Form pages for creating subjects and encounters
- Currently uses hardcoded static data

**Remaining Work:**

- Rebase on PR #28 after it merges
- Replace static data with API calls to #28 endpoints
- Complete record_detail.html integration
- Complete subject detail view (beyond list/create)
- Resolve note in PR description: "individual records / subject view are not finished"

**Decision:** Block on #28 merge, then rebase and integrate.

---

### PR #21: Add DTO for Django app (4697 additions, 458 deletions)

**Status:** Open since 2025-10-11 (4 months old), no recent activity  
**Branch:** feature/20-bfd9000_dicom-dto

**Implements:**

- Django-style DTO models for DICOM metadata
- Modality-specific converters (TIFF, PNG, JPEG, PDF, STL, radiograph, surface, document, photograph)
- Core DICOM builder and compression utilities
- Bolton-Brush metadata extractors
- Comprehensive test suite and documentation

**Problem:**

- `.py` source files missing from working tree (only `.pyc` bytecode remains)
- Likely significant merge conflicts after 4 months
- User mentioned cleaning up dicom4ortho anyway

**Decision Options:**

1. **Abandon** - Use dicom4ortho directly for Secondary Capture conversion
2. **Salvage** - Cherry-pick useful patterns/architecture into new code
3. **Restore & Merge** - Find source files and resolve conflicts

**Recommendation:** Abandon and focus on dicom4ortho integration - cleaner path for 2-day timeline.

## Outstanding Questions for User

1. **PR #21 decision:** Abandon, salvage, or restore/merge the bfd9000_dicom DTO work?
2. **dicom4ortho cleanup:** What specific Secondary Capture templates need to be added?
3. **Box API structure:** What's the desired folder hierarchy in Box?
4. **DICOM metadata:** Which fields should operators enter vs. auto-extract for new scans?
5. **PR #28 merge strategy:** Fast-track with known issues or full review resolution first?

## LLM Tool Recommendation

**Use Claude Opus/Sonnet 4 via OpenCode (current session)** - Best for interactive multi-repo integration work with human steering of key decisions.

**Why not Gemini:** Codebase is ~10k-20k lines total across all repos, fits comfortably in Claude's context. Quality of reasoning > raw context size for this task.

**Why not Codex async:** Loss of interactive feedback loop. The bottleneck is integration decisions needing human judgment, not LLM capability.
