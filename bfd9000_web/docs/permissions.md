- Curator has *no* rights for user/group/permission admin.
- DELETE is strictly superuser-only.

## Current Implementation Notes
- Group: `Curator` is auto-created by management command (`setup_curator_group`).
- Permissions: Curator keeps `add/change` on Subject/Encounter.
- Guardrails: command removes Curator delete perms for Subject/Encounter/Record and removes all `auth` app perms.
- "New Subject" and "New Encounter" UI is only displayed where user has appropriate permissions.

## How to Change Curator Permissions Later

To grant additional rights (e.g., delete) to the Curator group, run:

```
$ python manage.py setup_curator_group  # Safe to re-run anytime
```

Or, manually through Django admin:
1. Open the Django admin at `/admin/` as a superuser.
2. Navigate to Groups > Curator.
3. Add or remove permissions (e.g., `delete_subject`, `delete_encounter`, `delete_record`).

If you intentionally grant Curator additional rights manually, do not re-run `setup_curator_group` unless you also update that command to preserve the new policy.

**Warning:** Removing or adding user/group management or delete permissions may have significant impact. Ensure this is intentional and auditable. See also `archive/management/commands/setup_curator_group.py` source.
