# BFD9000

Contrary to popular belief, the BFD9000 stands for Bolton Files Dicomizer 9000. 9000 is just a huge version number, which is supposed to be intimidating.

Tools and processes to convert the Bolton-Brush Collection to digital format.

## Background

The Bolton Brush Growth Study Collection encompasses various types of X-rays, including lateral and poster-anterior X-rays of the cranium, as well as X-rays of the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, chest, pelvis, foot, and ankle, gathered from over 4000 subjects. This comprehensive collection also consists of dental cast models and paper charts, serving as a valuable resource for studying human growth and development. The majority of X-rays were collected in the 1930s, but the collection extended until the 1980s. To safeguard these valuable assets, approximately 500,000 X-ray films have been scanned and digitized over time.

Due to the vast scale of this project, numerous researchers, volunteers, and workers have participated. Consequently, the resulting x-rays were often saved in manually generated folders, leading to many inconsistencies in formatting and organization. The aim of this project is to provide tools for:

1. **Cleaning up the existing, scanned data:** This includes orienting all images consistently, dividing images that were collected on the same film, and saving them in a format intended for medical images (DICOM).
2. **Ensuring that the clean-up will be maintained in the future** with new scans, preserving the integrity and usability of the collection.

## Methods

We have chosen to use a neural network for correctly categorizing the images, determining their correct orientation, and identifying if and how to split them. A detailed explanation of the algorithms used can be found in the `documentation/` folder within this repository.

The tools will also likely include a GUI for the operator, assisting them in adding new scans consistently and avoiding the reintroduction of inconsistencies that were previously cleaned up.

## Future Uses

Other collections, such as [the ones in the AAOF Legacy Collection](https://www.aaoflegacycollection.org/), may also benefit from these tools. If needed, they can utilize them to achieve an organization based on an open standard like DICOM. This uniform approach could greatly enhance the research community's access to consistent and standardized datasets.

## Repository Structure

- `bfd9000_web/`: Django application for managing and viewing the BFD9000 data.
  To run the application, follow the instructions in `bfd9000_web/README.md`.

## Docker Notes

When you run the app with Docker you will need a one-time volume ownership fix so the app's non-root user can write media files.

See `docker.md` for the exact commands and troubleshooting steps.

## Django Bootstrap

The archive app provides a convenience management command to initialize a local development database:

`python bfd9000_web/manage.py initialize`

This runs:

- `migrate`
- `createsuperuser`
- `import_subjects` (Bolton + Lancaster by default)

See full command help:

`python bfd9000_web/manage.py help initialize`

## Generating Security Keys

When rotating keys, generate **two different values**:

- `SECRET_KEY` for Django signing/session security.
- `ENDPOINT_CREDENTIALS_KEY` for endpoint credential encryption (Fernet).

**Do not reuse one key for both variables.**

**Why?** If you use the same value for both `SECRET_KEY` and any encryption key, a leak in one area (e.g., Fernet credentials) could let an attacker forge Django cookies or CSRF tokens. Unique, random keys for each cryptographic use greatly reduce risk of whole-system compromise.

Generate a new Django `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Generate a new `ENDPOINT_CREDENTIALS_KEY` (valid Fernet key):

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Set both values in your environment (for example `bfd9000_web/.env` when using docker-compose).

## Configuration: Environment Variables

The web application is configured using the following environment variables. These can be provided via the environment, a `.env` file, or via Docker Compose.

**For subpath deployments**, you must set `DJANGO_FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` to your public path prefix (e.g., `/bfd9000`) to ensure all static/media/API/navigation work behind a proxy that strips this prefix.

A minimal `.env` example for development:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-key
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-public-hostname.example.com
DJANGO_FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME=/bfd9000
```

## Example: Nginx Reverse Proxy with Subpath (SCRIPT_NAME) Hosting

To deploy the Django server under a subpath (e.g., `/bfd9000`), use the following Nginx configuration:

```nginx
# Redirect /bfd9000 to /bfd9000/ for consistency
location = /bfd9000 {
    return 301 /bfd9000/;
}

# Host Django at /bfd9000/
location /bfd9000/ {
    # Trailing slash strips /bfd9000/ before proxying
    proxy_pass http://bfd9000:9000/;

    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    # Optionally inform upstream of prefix (most Django setups do NOT require this)
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /bfd9000;
}
```

- Set `DJANGO_FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME=/bfd9000` in the environment so Django generates URLs with the correct prefix.
- If your app listens on a different port (e.g., 8000), adjust `proxy_pass` accordingly.
- This config ensures all app URLs, static/media, forms, and fetch endpoints work at `/bfd9000`, regardless of the upstream root path.
